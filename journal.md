## May 19: Display troubles
LOG-002: unknown hours, most of day spent researching on and off

Effective displays land in two areas:
* Raspberry Pi specific:
  * Low resolution (1040x600 or 1280x720) touch, sometimes still expensive
* Non-touch laptop displays
  * Higher resolution no touch, more power draw

In this case, the choice I went with was a larger screen -- laptop displays -- which have upsides and downsides. One deal in particular stood out to be when finding displays, and it is an ebay listing with high ratings and a IPS 1920x1080 15.6 inch monitor. At only $35 + $15 in shipping, this is by far the best deal I've come across. The downside? Quite high power draw. It's estimated to have 15-25 watts depending on brightness.
