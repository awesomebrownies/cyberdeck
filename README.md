# cyberdeck

A portable cyberdeck designed around accessories and working on the move.

## Key features
* **Controllers on both sides**: Joystick: Mouse/Scrolling, Scroll Wheel: Zoom/Custom, Trigger: Left/Right Click, Button: Extra, 4x Capacitive Sensors: Typing
  * Foldable controllers on both sides for compact travel & when deployed, (space for cooling fan, since controllers go lower than the main body)
* **Typing with hand tracking**! Control hand will lift fingers to change mode (ex: [index raise row, middle lower, both number row], ring SHIFT, pinky Thumb Row)
* **Picatinny Rails**: Used to attach custom gadgets to the device. I will have a gun sling on it so it can go around my neck while on the move.
* **Physical Toggle Switches** on right side: Power, & custom software modes
* **Debugging Station**: Since I'm using a RPi 5 8gb, I can access pins to test out electronic parts on the fly!
